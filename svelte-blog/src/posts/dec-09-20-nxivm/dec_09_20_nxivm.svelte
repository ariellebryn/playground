<PostQuote author="Sophie Gilbert" title="How to Tell the Story of a Cult" url="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/11/nxivm-two-ways-seduced-and-the-vow/617038/" publication="The Atlantic">
    The differences in how [The Vow and Seduced] use archival footage are small but notable....The Vow offers up scenes that substantiate what Edmondson and Vicente are saying: that anyone could have been drawn in by NXIVM’s promise of blissful community and altruistic intentions. Seduced shows a cult in full bloom, and outsiders offer crucial context into what’s being seen onscreen. If The Vow’s desire is to prove to people watching how enticing the NXIVM community might have seemed, Seduced’s is to expose how disturbing it really was—how the triathlons and singing groups were cover for a leader trying to see how far he could push people to obey him.

    After reading this article, I was curious whether the differences between <i>The Vow</i> and <i>Seduced</i> (both documentaries on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/nyregion/nxivm-cult-keith-raniere-sentenced.html" target="_blank">NXIVM</a>) could be visualized through the colors they use in their imagery.

    So I found the dominant color in every frame from each doc's trailer. <i>Each little box of color below represents the dominant color of a single frame of each trailer, in time-order from left to right, top to bottom:</i>

    It's not exactly a fair fight–<i>The Vow</i>'s' trailer is a minute longer than <i>Seduced</i>'s–but there's clearly more lightness and color at the start of <i>The Vow</i>'s trailer (look at the buildup of green versus the fade-from-black in <i>Seduced</i>). There's also a lot more warmth–more deep reds and purples–compared to <i>Seduced</i>'s blues and grays. And even if they both boil down to something murky and gray, the average color of <i>The Vow</i>'s trailer is lighter than that of <i>Seduced</i>.

    I'm not saying this means anything for the content exactly, but it's an interesting reflection of the images each doc chose to promote itself. It seems to me, as Sophie says in her article, <i>The Vow</i> chose to use imagery that was just a little lighter and a little more warm to represent NXIVM in the kind of light a member might see it in.
